# Week 1 – Server Installation & Configuration

## Step 1: Installing Windows Server 2019
I created a new VirtualBox VM and installed **Windows Server 2019 Desktop Experience**.  
This establishes the base operating system for all future labs.

## Step 2: Configuring Hostname and Administrator Password
I renamed the computer to **Server2019-Cameron** and set a strong Administrator password.  
A clear hostname and secure credentials help manage the server safely in a networked environment.

## Step 3: Setting Static IP and Time Zone
I confirmed network settings and used `ipconfig /all` to view the IP configuration.  
A correct IP address and time zone ensure the server can communicate with other systems reliably.

## Step 4: Server Manager Verification and Updates
I opened **Server Manager** to verify hostname, IP address, and basic roles view.  
This confirms the installation was successful and the server is ready for future role deployment.
