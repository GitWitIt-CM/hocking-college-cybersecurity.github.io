### Task / Purpose
Implement Hyper-V virtualization on Windows Server 2019 and demonstrate rapid server deployment.  
Compare the local Hyper-V environment to AWS EC2 cloud compute services.

---

### Environment / Tools
- Windows Server 2019 + Hyper-V Manager (MindTap Lab)  
- Two VMs – Server and Client (Windows 10 or Server Core)  
- AWS CloudQuest / AWS Management Console (EC2 + AMI overview)  
- Azure / IBM AI resources (predictive scaling readings)

---

### Steps Performed
1. Enabled the **Hyper-V role** and management tools.  
2. Created **two VMs** with specific CPU, RAM, and disk settings.  
3. Configured **virtual switch** networking.  
4. Installed the OS and performed initial configuration.  
5. Created **checkpoints** and cloned VMs for rapid deployment.  
6. Compared Hyper-V resource allocation and scaling to **AWS EC2** instances.  
7. Captured screenshots of each configuration step.

- `assets/week02_vm_settings_02.png` – VM resource allocation  
- `assets/week02_aws_comparison_03.png` – AWS EC2 comparison chart  

---

### Results
- Successfully deployed and cloned VMs in Hyper-V.  
- Verified network connectivity between VMs.  
- Identified similarities and differences between Hyper-V and EC2 deployment models.

---

### Reflection / Lessons Learned
I learned how Hyper-V enables rapid VM provisioning on-prem and how this compares to AWS EC2’s cloud scaling.  
Understanding virtualization concepts helps bridge on-prem infrastructure and cloud compute models.

### Reproducibility Notes
Ensure Windows Server 2019 is updated and has Hyper-V enabled.  
Use at least 8 GB RAM for two VMs and enable nested virtualization if running inside a VM.
